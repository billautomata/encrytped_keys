# private_keys
experimental personal private key repository, yes it's in the open, it's all deeply encrypted

These are the keys for personal services that if comprimised would have no repurcussions on privacy or anonymity of others.

In order to do anything with this information you would need my master private key and my passphrase.

I rotate and destroy the master keys regularly, re-encrypting the information found in this repo.
